This was a very simplistic scenario of the creation of a ticket by a user, how the ticket is assigned and displays the communication of a ticket between agents; subsequently resulting in a resolution.
<p> There are additional scenarios that can also happen while a ticket is being assessed. A ticket can either be reassigned to a different department, escalated in severeity level, or needs to be both reassigned to a more qualified agent/department to handle the issue, depending on business impacts.
